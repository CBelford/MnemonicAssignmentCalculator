Utility which aids in the unique assignment of mnemonics for menus, buttons, etc.

Provided a list of strings which require mnemonic assignment, the utility will:

1.  Determine if enough unique characters exist to even proceed with attempting mnemonic assignment;

2.  Attempt to determine mnemonic assignments, writing suggestions to disk when assignments are determined; and

3.  Inform the user when unique mnemonic assignments do not exist.

Unfortunately, the code does require a brute force approach for determining assignments.  However, the assignment operation is optimized by looking for the "difficult" letters first using a common scale of the relative frequency with which letters appear in the english language (i.e. Scrabble weights).
